/**
 * Analyze a resume from a given URL for a specified target role and persist the analysis for the current user.
 *
 * This function:
 * - Resolves the current authenticated user via getCurrentUser().
 * - Validates inputs (resumeUrl, targetRole, fileName) and returns early (with console logging) if validation fails.
 * - Calls analyzeResume(resumeUrl, targetRole) and, if the analysis is successful, creates a new resume record in the database via prisma.resume.create().
 * - Logs progress and errors to the console.
 *
 * @param resumeUrl - URL pointing to the resume file to analyze (e.g., a publicly accessible PDF URL).
 * @param targetRole - The job title or target role to evaluate the resume against (e.g., "Frontend Engineer").
 * @param fileName - Original file name of the resume; the stored title is derived by removing the file extension.
 *
 * @returns A Promise that resolves to one of:
 * - { success: true, data: object } when analysis and storage succeed. The data object contains analysis results such as atsScore, strengths, weaknesses, and suggestions.
 * - { success: false, error: string } when an unexpected error occurs during analysis or storage.
 * - undefined when validation fails (no authenticated user or missing parameters) or when analyzeResume returns a falsy result or a result indicating failure (result.ok === false). In these cases diagnostic messages are logged and no database record is created.
 *
 * @remarks
 * - Side effects: writes to the database (prisma.resume.create) and emits console logs.
 * - External dependencies: getCurrentUser(), analyzeResume(), and a configured Prisma client (prisma).
 * - The function catches and logs unexpected errors and returns a failure object in the catch block.
